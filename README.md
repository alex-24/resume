# Resume

This repository contains the static site render my personal resume.

The site is built using a custom JSON-powered engine that supports:

- Internationalization (EN/FR)
- Layout reorganization via config
- Flavoring (context-specific CV variants for different audiences)

It's not a template or product, just the source of my own resume with no extra options.
